Added three new columns to clothing tabs, \"Gender\", \"Villager Gender\", and \"Seasonality\", which all influence how NPCs interact with the item. Fixed some values for the 1.5.0 items and updated some museum phrases.\r\n\r\nUpdate 09/30: Halloween items are here! Added all new recipes and items from 1.5.0 with associated data, added new Reactions, added Jack to Special NPC tab. Added `Default Umbrella` column to Villagers tab. Added `Inventory Filename` and `Storage Filename` columns to Other tab. Minor fixes to various source notes, DIY sell prices, and other minor fixes. Deleted `Version Unlocked` column.\r\n\r\nPlease join the Discord server if you are a developer and need a more in-depth changelog.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of our spreadsheet is to create a complete collection of data on items, villagers, achievements, and more!
